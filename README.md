# Recurrent Neural Networks: time series prediction


Recurrent neural network for time series prediction

This project involves a recurrent neural network (RNN) regressor to forecast the price of Apple stock 7 days in advance. The network will employ [Long Term Short Memory (LSTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) architecture in Keras.
